# odin-landing-page
Landing page project for theodinproject.

This project is part of theodinproject's foundations. The link to this project original github page is: https://github.com/TheOdinProject/curriculum/blob/main/foundations/html_css/project/html-css-foundations-project.md. This projects involves creating a website based on a given design. Flexbox will be heavily utilised.

This project is part of my learning journey of HTML/CSS/JS. I am not currently exclusively following theodinproject's curriculum, but it is a part of it (at least when it comes to some exercises to do).

The design to be realised was described by the following two images:

https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/colors_and_stuff.png

These are also inside the img folder if the links above are not working. I have no trademark over these, they are provided by theodinproject.
